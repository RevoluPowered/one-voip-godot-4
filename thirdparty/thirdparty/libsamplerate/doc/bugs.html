<P>
	If you are a user and have a problem using libsamplerate with another piece
	of software, you should contact the author of that other software and get
	them to explore their use of this library and possibly submit a bug report.
	If you are a coder and think you have found a bug in libsamplerate then
	read on.
</P>
<P>
	Secret Rabbit Code is an extremely complex piece of code but I do think
	that it is relatively bug free.
	In addition, the source code distribution includes a comprehensive test
	suite for regression testing.
	This means it is extremely unlikely that new bugs creep in when
	modifications are made to the code.
</P>
<P>
	SRC is also not the most simple library to use which means that I do get
	a number of bug reports which turn out to be bugs in the user's program
	rather than bugs in SRC.
	Up until now, I have investigated each bug report as thoroughly as
	possible.
	Unfortunately, this chews up a lot of my time which could otherwise be
	spent improving SRC, working on other Free Software or spending time
	with my family.
</P>
<P>
	I have therefore decided, that I cannot investigate any bug report unless
	the person reporting the problem can supply me with a short self contained
	test program or a modification to one of the existing test programs in
	the tests/ directory of the source code distribution.
	The test program should meet the following criteria:
</P>
	<UL>
	<LI>Written in C or C++.
	<LI>Does not use any libraries or header files other than the ones which are
		standard for the relevant languages. (Of course libsamplerate can be
		used :-)).
	<LI>It is the minimal program which can adequately display the problem.
	<LI>It clearly displays the criteria for pass or fail.
	</UL>
<P>
	Supplying a good test program will maximize the speed with which your bug
	report gets dealt with.
</P>
